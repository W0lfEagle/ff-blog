          Bulding on my ICF accredited diploma from the Animas Centre and my
          past work as a relocation coach, my approach to coaching is grounded
          in a sense of compassionate enquiry, creating a non-judgmental space
          for you to explore the unique set of  beliefs and values that underpin
          your life and choices. Through collaborative questioning and
          exercises, you will find new perspectives to create inner shifts that
          translate into action.

          My approach is adapted to each client’s particular needs and goals. I
          believe that you as the client are creative, resourceful and whole. My
          role is to accompany you on this transformative journey by helping you
          access your inner creativity.  I meet you where you are, listening in
          order to understand what will work best for you.

          The first step towards starting this journey is to schedule a free
          call where we will have a chat about what you’re looking for and where
          you want to go. The call will include some coaching so even if you’re
          not sure you’re ready to commit, this is a wonderful place to get a
          taste for what might be possible without any obligation.

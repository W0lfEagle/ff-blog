title1: Coaching with me...
body1: >-
  Bulding on my ICF accredited diploma from the Animas Centre and my past work
  as a relocation coach, my approach to coaching is grounded in a sense of
  compassionate enquiry, creating a non-judgmental space for you to explore the
  unique set of  beliefs and values that underpin your life and choices. Through
  collaborative questioning and exercises, you will find new perspectives to
  create inner shifts that translate into action.




  My approach is adapted to each client’s particular needs and goals. I believe
  that you as the client are creative, resourceful and whole. My role is to
  accompany you on this transformative journey by helping you access your inner
  creativity.  I meet you where you are, listening in order to understand what
  will work best for you.
title2: Let's talk...
body2: >-
  The first step towards starting this journey is to schedule a free call where
  we will have a chat about what you’re looking for and where you want to go.
  The call will include some coaching so even if you’re not sure you’re ready to
  commit, this is a wonderful place to get a taste for what might be possible
  without any obligation.
title3: The details...

  Sessions take place via phone, video call or in-person in east London on a
  weekly or bi-weekly basis.

      I started working with Felicity during a time in my life when I was
      feeling stuck and wanted to start making some positive changes. I wasn’t
      really sure if the coaching process would work for me. But Felicity was
      incredibly easy to work with and made me feel comfortable to explore what
      was possible. I really liked that she held a space for me to contemplate
      my thoughts, feelings and beliefs. I found the coaching process helpful in
      prompting me to take a creative approach to change and take actions to
      create the change I want for myself.

      Thank you, Felicity. I liked working with you a lot! Before we started
      working together, I was feeling a lack of confidence, especially when
      meeting new people. After only 6 sessions together, it’s difficult to 
      choose one main benefit, as I had important insights in every session. In
      our last session, I realised that one of my limiting beliefs has changed.
      I identified this belief in our first session together and it has been
      influencing me for years. Now I don’t believe it anymore!


      No matter how I was feeling at the beginning of each session, I always
      felt much more positive and inspired by the end. I really enjoyed our
      sessions together.

      The main benefits I found were from you helping me voice the things out
      loud which I subconsciously knew but had never verbalised. You were also
      really good at leading me deeper to the root of any thoughts and beliefs
      and thinking about where those things came from. Also you were really easy
      to talk to which I liked and had a lovely tonality and gentleness.

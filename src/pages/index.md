    Navigate Transition. Harness the power of change. Craft a life brimming with
    possibility and purpose.
  description: >
    Change arrives in many forms. Maybe an unwelcome change has turned your life
    upside down. Or perhaps you are feeling stuck and would welcome a change.

    A desire for change is the ideal starting point for our work together - even
    if you don’t know exactly what that change might be.

    Drawing on my own experiences, I specialise in working with clients who have
    recently moved or experienced significant change in their lives.

  Coaching is a journey of self-awareness combining exploration, reflection,
  motivation, goal-setting and action to help you connect to your truest self
  and create the life you want.

  heading: My Approach
  description: >-
    Drawing on my own experiences of change and transition (10 international
    moves in the last 15 years!), I will help you know and trust yourself more
    fully to live a self-directed life. My approach is steeped in
    self-compassion, mindfulness and practicality. The inspiration for my
    coaching approach is mined from my own journey from teacher to corporate
    consultant and now coach. I don't have all the answers but I do have a long
    list of questions - and my passion is helping others start asking the
    questions that will unlock the door to knowing themselves more truly and
    tapping into their inner wisdom.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

    I help people know, trust and express themselves in times of transition to
    thrive with intention.

  Through one-to-one coaching packages delivered online or face-to-face in east
  London, my goal is to help clients mindfully navigate change or intentionally
  create change in their lives.   My work is steeped in a gentle sense of
  compassionate enquiry, kind curiosity, empathy and humor.   With an ICF
  accredited diploma in Transformational Coaching,  I take a holistic,
  integrative approach to coaching, as a method to explore your inner landscape
  and create space for you to more fully understand yourself.  Drop me a line if
  this sounds like you. Our first call is free and a wonderful place to get a
  taste for coaching without any commitment.

  heading: My Approach
  description: >-
    Drawing on my own experiences of change and transition (10 international
    moves in the last 15 years!), I will help you know and trust yourself more
    fully to live a self-directed life. My approach is steeped in
    self-compassion, mindfulness and practicality. The inspiration for my
    coaching approach is mined from my own journey from teacher to corporate
    consultant and now coach. I don't have all the answers but I do have a long
    list of questions - and my passion is helping others start asking the
    questions that will unlock the door to knowing themselves more truly and
    tapping into their inner wisdom.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

    Hi, I’m Felicity and I have been working as a relocation coach and language
    teacher for the last 9 years, helping clients navigate international
    transitions such as moves and career changes.

  Having lived and worked in over 7 different countries, I understand the unique
  challenges and rewards of building a home, career and community in a new
  place. Drawing on my own personal experiences, in addition to my work as an
  English teacher, I have assisted clients from all over the world in adapting
  to life in foreign countries providing settling in, linguistic and emotional
  support.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

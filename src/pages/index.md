    Navigate Transition. Harness the power of change. Craft a life brimming with
    possibility and purpose.

    Change arrives in many forms. Maybe an unwelcome change has turned your life
    upside down. Or perhaps you are feeling stuck and would welcome a change.

    A simple desire for change is the ideal starting point for our work together
    - even if you don’t know exactly what that change might be. 

    Drawing on my own experiences, I specialise in working with clients who have
    recently moved or experienced significant change in their lives.

  Having lived and worked in over 7 different countries, I understand the unique
  challenges and rewards of building a home, career and community in a new
  place. Drawing on my own personal experiences, in addition to my work as an
  English teacher, I have assisted clients from all over the world in adapting
  to life in foreign countries providing settling in, linguistic and emotional
  support.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

      I would like to send you a huge heartfelt thank you for your wonderful
      course. I started my blog only a few months before the course began so I
      was a complete novice and not feeling all that confident. All the ideas
      and prompts and encouragement for revealing our true selves in a voice
      authentic to us, plus the wonderful community of creative women, have made
      this not only a truly memorable and rich experience, but also a very
      practically useful one for establishing our own unique web presence. Thank
      you for so generously sharing yourself with us!

      Blogging from the Heart turned out to be one of my favorite e-courses.
      Thank you so much for putting it together! You’ve inspired me to finally
      take the plunge and make my blog into the space I’ve always dreamed of.
      Your design tips and writing prompts have helped me get through days where
      inspiration wouldn’t flow freely and inspired me to reveal a little more
      of myself in my writing. With your guidance my blog has finally become a
      place for community. I couldn’t have asked for more! I’m looking forward
      to the pdf and will definitely be suggesting this class to any blogger I
      know who wants to take things to the next level. I can’t believe it all
      went by so quickly!

I’m a coach, teacher and traveler who has been on a winding quest for purpose in work for the past 10 years and am now crafting the life and work that fills me with joy. I help people know, trust and express themselves in times of transition in order to intentionally create a self-directed life. 

Through one-to-one coaching packages delivered online or face-to-face in east London, my goal is to help clients mindfully navigate change or intentionally create change in their lives. My work is steeped in a gentle sense of compassionate enquiry, kind curiosity, empathy and humor. 

The twists and turns of my life over the past 10 years reflect how I continually changed my external circumstances in a search for fulfillment without first turning my gaze inwards. As I now step further into my own soul exploration, my passion is helping others to start asking themselves the questions that will create the inner shifts to thrive through transition and change.

Drop me a line if this sounds like you. I’d love to have a chat about coaching or hear about your own experiences navigating change. 

I’m so glad you’re here.
